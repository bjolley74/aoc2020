# aoc2020

This is repository for the 2020 [Advent of Code challenge](www.adventofcode.com).

I am writing all of my code for AOC in python. Each day's challenge is in a folder `dayn` where `n` is the day of the challenge. Likewise the code is in the `dayn.py` file. For example, the sixth day of the challenge is in `day6/` folder and is named `day6.py`. The input for the day's challenge in a file called `puzzle_input.txt`. In each `dayn` folder is the file `aoc_input.py` which I wrote to read the file `puzzle_input.txt` and return a list object with the appropriate input for the challenge. 

Included in the main folder is `new_day.py` which I wrote to automate adding a new folder for the day with the included files. 

There are a few days that I did not include in this repository as I had to review other's solutions to solve the puzzle. I did not wish to put any code here that maybe influenced by other's design as I do not want anyone to accuse trying to pass others code as my own.
